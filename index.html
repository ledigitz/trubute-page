<h3>Thank You</h3>
I'll forever be in debt to Steve Jobs for having the vision to create a machine able to change ideas into reality. My first Apple inspired me to take my love for art and make it my career when I truly didn't know where my life was going. I honestly think it is because of my time on an Apple that I choose to become a graphic designer. It's truly a sad day and my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family. Steve... You'll be missed.

<h3>You are one contributor who made my personal world and universe better</h3>
The first computer at my home was an Apple II my father allowed me to play with. Steve Jobs was a visionary, but a very practical producer who payed special attention to the human being as a fluid user. I hope this halt moment of reflexion will give us all the good will to understand the real problems and challenges we are facing today and will face tomorrow. You are one contributor who made my personal world and universe better. I will miss you in a very good way. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.

<h3>good bye and thank you!</h3>
Dear Apple Team, I would like to share my thoughts with you. When I saw Steve´s speech at stanford on youtube I thought, somehow, he was also talking about me. I dropped out of college in New Jersey and that also was the best thing that ever happened to me. I didnt know what to do and my parents cut me out- I had a couple of bucks in my pocket and, since I am peruvian who went to school to play soccer, I was facing a visa status change to "ilegal " I couldn't return home because I had this feeling I wasted a lot of my parents money in a college not only I didnt finished, but I also didnt care about. So I decided to stay in the US. I moved to Virginia and started working in a restaurant. I started as a busboy and ended up as an assistant manager. I loved the restaurant life and I fell in love with the kitchen It´s been 7 years now and after working with many important chefs in the Washington DC area, I returned to Peru were I´m finishing my cuisine diploma at Le Cordon Bleu Peru and I am also opening my own restaurant at the end of this month. So I guess the dots conected somehow. From Lima, Peru Good bye and Thank you Steve Jobs!

<h3>Remembering you</h3>
Dear Steve, I know that you do not know me, or, that I had any ties with you. I would just like to say a very big thank you, for your contributions, to our modern technology. You gave us the greatest inventions of our times.
